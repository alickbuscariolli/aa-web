      Who we are
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Additive Atlas started as a project proposal for an Assignment at AIT - Academy of Information Technology. Which we take it to develop and proper design according to the users needs and specifications. We find out that nowadays people are getting busier every day. Our intention is to make it easier for the users so they donâ€™t have to worry about what they are going to cook if they only have a few things on fridge. Also we are passionate about IT and always developing a new team. Our bound grown up every day while releasing new features for Additive Atlas Website.<br /><br />

      We also would like to thank you for all support and visiting our website. <br><br>

      Why Additive Atlas?<br><br>

      As Additive is a synonym of ingredients and Atlas means book we thought it would be great putting these words together and creating the AA.
